# pr

Use this skill when the user asks for `pr`, pull request preparation, PR unit
decisions, PR description drafting, PR review readiness, or squash-merge history
cleanup.

## Core Behavior

- Treat each PR as a permanent history record because this project uses squash
  merge by default.
- Optimize PR title and body for future readers who need to understand which PR
  introduced a change and why it was made.
- Prefer reviewable, history-meaningful PR units over file-count or commit-count
  boundaries.
- Write PR titles and descriptions in English.
- Use `cm` before PR finalization when the working tree contains uncommitted
  changes or the PR boundary is unclear.
- Treat an explicit `pr` request with uncommitted changes as approval to prepare
  the necessary commits first. Do not stop only to ask whether to commit when the
  diff is a clear, commit-ready PR unit.
- Treat an explicit request to open or update a PR as approval to use the
  prepared title and body and run the PR tool without a separate confirmation
  step.
- Never fabricate verification. Clearly report tests that were run, skipped, or
  could not be run.
- Never revert, overwrite, or discard user changes unless explicitly instructed.

## PR Unit Definition

A PR is one squash-merge history event. It should remain understandable when the
branch history contains only the squash commit title and the PR body.

Each PR candidate must pass this checklist:

- **Single history event**: The change can be explained as one problem,
  requirement, decision, or cleanup.
- **Clear reason**: A future reader can understand why the change happened
  without reconstructing the entire diff.
- **Reviewable boundary**: A reviewer can approve or reject the PR as one
  coherent decision.
- **Revertable intent**: Reverting the squash commit would remove one coherent
  change, not unrelated work.
- **Coherent verification**: The test or inspection evidence maps to the PR's
  stated intent.
- **No hidden bundle**: The PR does not hide unrelated refactors, dependency
  upgrades, documentation changes, or cleanup under a feature or fix.

If a candidate fails the checklist, propose splitting the PR. If splitting would
make the history less understandable or create broken intermediate states,
explain why the larger PR is acceptable.

## Split Rules

Keep together:

- A feature, fix, or refactor with tests that directly verify it.
- Types, configuration, migrations, lockfiles, or documentation required to make
  the same change understandable and working.
- Small supporting cleanup when it only exists to make the main change possible
  and would be misleading as a separate PR.

Split by default:

- Feature work and unrelated refactoring.
- Bug fixes and opportunistic cleanup.
- Dependency upgrades and behavior changes that merely use the upgraded
  dependency.
- Test infrastructure changes and tests for a product change.
- Documentation-only changes and runtime behavior changes.
- Changes that need different reviewers or different rollback decisions.

Ask the user before finalizing the PR plan when:

- The PR boundary is a product decision rather than a code-structure decision.
- Review boundaries and history boundaries conflict.
- Part of the diff appears to be unfinished user work.

## Split Decision Before Opening PRs

Before opening or updating a PR, always decide the PR unit and include that
decision in the PR preparation output or final user report. Do not pause only to
ask the user to approve the split decision when the boundary is clear.

Use `git diff --name-status` or the branch comparison to group the diff by
change kind before deciding the PR unit:

- Documentation-only convention changes.
- Runtime or API behavior changes.
- Lint, build, test tooling, or harness changes.
- Shared refactors or cross-layer contracts.
- Dependency or lockfile changes.
- Tests.

Split by default when the diff mixes documentation-only convention changes with
runtime behavior changes. Split by default when the diff mixes lint/tooling
changes with product behavior, unless the tooling change is required to keep the
same PR buildable and reviewable. Split by default when dependency changes are
not solely required by the same runtime change.

If the final plan keeps multiple change kinds in one PR, state the reason in
the PR body or final report. Acceptable reasons include avoiding a broken
intermediate state, keeping required tests with the behavior they verify, or
keeping a small shared contract change that is necessary for the same boundary.
Do not open a large mixed PR without documenting why it is one PR instead of
multiple PRs.

## cm Skill Coordination

Use `cm` as the commit-level preparation step and `pr` as the PR-level history
step.

- If there are uncommitted changes, inspect the diff and use `cm` rules to form
  atomic commit candidates before drafting the PR.
- When those candidates are clear and belong to the requested PR, create the
  commits before drafting the PR without asking for another approval. The `pr`
  request is the approval to perform this commit-preparation step.
- The PR unit is not automatically the same as one commit. A PR can contain
  multiple atomic commits when they form one squash-merge history event.
- Use each commit's `Why:` body as input for the PR-level `Why`, but do not
  paste commit messages as a changelog.
- Move verification reported during `cm` work into the PR `Verification`
  section.
- If `cm` suggests multiple unrelated commit groups, propose multiple PRs unless
  the user explicitly wants one combined PR.

## PR Title Rules

The title is the default squash-merge commit subject, so make it useful in
`git log`.

Subject format:

```text
<type>: <imperative summary>
```

Examples:

```text
feat: add health check endpoint
fix: reject invalid registration payloads
docs: document PR history rules
```

Rules:

- Follow Conventional Commit style when it fits the change.
- Start the summary with an imperative verb.
- Prefer intent over implementation detail.
- Use a scope only when it adds clear value.
- Do not end the title with a period.
- Avoid vague titles such as `fix bug`, `update code`, or `refactor stuff`.

## PR Body Rules

Use this structure by default:

```markdown
## Summary

- ...

## Why

...

## Changes

- ...

## Verification

- ...

## Risk / Notes

- ...
```

Section rules:

- `Summary`: State what the PR accomplishes in one to three bullets.
- `Why`: Preserve the durable context: the problem, requirement, decision,
  tradeoff, constraint, or alternative that explains why this PR exists.
- `Changes`: List the meaningful behavior or structure changes. Do not produce a
  file-by-file diff summary unless the file boundary is the point.
- `Verification`: List exact commands, tests, manual checks, or inspections that
  were performed. Include skipped or unavailable verification when relevant.
- `Risk / Notes`: Call out migrations, compatibility concerns, rollout notes,
  follow-up work, reviewer focus areas, or state `None` when there is nothing
  notable.

Do not include:

- A long commit-by-commit changelog.
- Generic checklist filler.
- Claims that tests passed unless they were actually run.
- Review instructions that belong in the user response rather than the PR body.

## Workflow

1. Inspect `git status --short`, recent commits, and the relevant diff or branch
   comparison.
2. If the working tree has uncommitted changes, apply `cm` rules first to
   identify atomic commit candidates.
3. If the commit candidates are clear, commit-ready, and belong to the requested
   PR, stage and commit them before drafting the PR.
4. Ask the user before committing only when the diff appears unfinished, includes
   unrelated user work, has unclear commit boundaries, or should likely split
   into multiple PRs.
5. Decide whether the change belongs in one PR or multiple PRs using the PR unit
   checklist and the split gate.
6. Record the PR unit decision before opening or updating any PR.
7. Draft the PR title as the future squash-merge commit subject.
8. Draft the PR body using the default sections, emphasizing durable `Why`
   context.
9. Report any verification gaps separately if they need user attention before the
   PR is opened.
10. If the user asks to open or update the PR with a tool, open or update it
    with the drafted title and body without asking for another approval, unless
    a blocker requires user input.
